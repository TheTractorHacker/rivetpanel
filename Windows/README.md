# RivetPanel (Windows)

A lightweight Windows tray app that lets end users submit an RivetIT/RivetMSP support
ticket — with an optional full-screen screenshot — in a few clicks, with no
portal login.

## How it works

1. Runs in the system tray, starting on login.
2. Click the tray icon (or "New Ticket") to open a small popup:
   - Subject
   - Description
   - "Attach Screenshot" (captures the full screen, shows a thumbnail,
     can be retaken or removed)
3. "Submit" posts the ticket to RivetIT/RivetMSP via the API, then the window closes
   after a brief success message.

## RivetIT/RivetMSP API call

```
POST {rivet_base_url}/api/v1/tickets?api_key={api_key}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

subject=...
details=...
client_id=...
contact_id=...      (optional)
priority=Medium
file=@screenshot.png (optional)
```

This requires RivetIT/RivetMSP **v2.11.32 or later**, which added multipart/form-data
support (with an optional `file`/`files[]` attachment) to ticket creation —
see `agent` repo commit "API: support file attachments on ticket creation,
replies, and unify attachment storage". On older versions, ticket creation
only accepts a JSON body and has no attachment support.

The `api_key` is a **legacy API key** (Admin > API Keys in RivetIT/RivetMSP). Note:

- It must be sent as a `?api_key=` query string parameter — for
  multipart/form-data POST bodies, the JSON-body fallback does not apply.
- The legacy key authenticates as the first active admin user (RivetIT/RivetMSP does
  not currently scope legacy-key requests to `api_key_client_id`); the
  `client_id` field in `config.json` is what actually assigns the ticket
  to the right client.
- Treat the API key as a shared secret across all machines it's deployed
  to — anyone with it can create tickets for any client via this endpoint.

## Files

- `tray_app.py` — the application (pystray + tkinter + Pillow + requests)
- `config.json` — config template, deployed to
  `%ProgramData%\RivetPanel\config.json`
- `rivetpanel.spec` — PyInstaller spec, produces a single
  windowed `.exe` (no console)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `deploy/deploy_rivetpanel.ps1` — TacticalRMM deployment script (silently
  runs the installer with per-client config)
- `assets/icon.ico` — branded tray/installer icon
- `../installer/RivetPanel.iss` — Inno Setup script that builds the
  configurable installer
- `../.github/workflows/build.yml` — CI: builds the exe + installer on
  every push, and attaches both to a GitHub release for tags `v*`

## Getting a build

### Option A: GitHub Actions (no Windows machine needed)

Push a tag like `v1.0.0` (or just push to `master` / run the workflow
manually) and GitHub Actions will build on a `windows-latest` runner and
upload:

- `RivetPanel.exe` — the bare tray app
- `RivetPanelSetup.exe` — the full installer (recommended)

For tag pushes (`v*`), both files are also attached to a GitHub release.

### Option B: Build locally on Windows

```powershell
cd Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller rivetpanel.spec
# Output: Windows\dist\RivetPanel.exe

# Then build the installer (requires Inno Setup 6: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
cd ..\installer
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" RivetPanel.iss
# Output: installer\Output\RivetPanelSetup.exe
```

To rebrand the tray icon, replace `Windows/assets/icon.ico` (also used as
the installer icon) before building.

## Installer (`RivetPanelSetup.exe`)

Running the installer prompts for the RivetIT/RivetMSP connection settings (base URL,
API key, Client ID, Contact ID, Priority) on a dedicated wizard page, then:

- Installs `RivetPanel.exe` to `C:\Program Files\RivetPanel`
- Writes `C:\ProgramData\RivetPanel\config.json` from the entered
  values
- Adds a shortcut to the All Users Startup folder so it launches on every
  login
- Offers to launch the app immediately

### Unattended / silent install

All wizard fields can be supplied as command-line parameters, which also
pre-fill the wizard if shown:

```
RivetPanelSetup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART ^
  /RivetBaseUrl=https://psa.example.com ^
  /ApiKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ^
  /ClientId=5 ^
  /ContactId=12 ^
  /Priority=Medium
```

## Deploying via TacticalRMM

1. Get `RivetPanelSetup.exe` from a GitHub release (Option A above)
   and host it somewhere TacticalRMM can download it from — the direct
   release asset URL works fine, e.g.:

   ```
   https://github.com/TheTractorHacker/rivetpanel/releases/latest/download/RivetPanelSetup.exe
   ```

2. In TacticalRMM, add `deploy/deploy_rivetpanel.ps1` as a script (type
   **PowerShell**, run as **System**), then set its **Script Arguments**
   to a single line per client, e.g.:

   ```
   -InstallerUrl "https://github.com/TheTractorHacker/rivetpanel/releases/latest/download/RivetPanelSetup.exe" -RivetBaseUrl "https://psa.example.com" -ApiKey "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" -ClientId 5 -ContactId 12 -Priority "Medium"
   ```

   | Argument | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `-InstallerUrl`  | URL to `RivetPanelSetup.exe` (above) |
   | `-RivetBaseUrl` | e.g. `https://psa.example.com` |
   | `-ApiKey`        | API key from Admin > API Keys |
   | `-ClientId`      | RivetIT/RivetMSP `client_id` for this client |
   | `-ContactId`     | (optional) RivetIT/RivetMSP `contact_id`, omit or use `0` |
   | `-Priority`      | (optional) `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Critical`, default `Medium` |

   This downloads and silently runs the installer with those settings,
   which installs the app, writes `config.json`, and sets up the Startup
   shortcut — then launches the app for the current session if one exists.

### Upgrading

Running the same installer again (manually, or by re-running the
TacticalRMM script above) upgrades an existing install in place: it closes
the running tray app, replaces the exe, and restarts it — no uninstall
step needed. If you don't pass connection settings on an upgrade run, the
existing `config.json` values are kept automatically.

Machines still running the old **ITFlow Quick Ticket** are also upgraded
cleanly: `RivetPanelSetup.exe` detects the previous install, silently
uninstalls it, and migrates its `config.json` to the new
`%ProgramData%\RivetPanel\` location.

### Self-update

The tray app's "Check for Updates" menu item checks the GitHub releases feed
and, if a newer version is available, offers to download `RivetPanelSetup.exe`
and run it silently — the running app is closed and restarted automatically
once the update finishes, with no manual download/rerun needed.

## Config reference (`config.json`)

| Field                  | Required | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `rivet_base_url`      | yes      | e.g. `https://psa.example.com`              |
| `api_key`               | yes      | Legacy API key from Admin > API Keys           |
| `client_id`             | yes      | RivetIT/RivetMSP `client_id` this install belongs to     |
| `contact_id`            | no       | RivetIT/RivetMSP `contact_id` to attach to the ticket    |
| `priority`              | no       | `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Critical` (default `Medium`) |
| `include_system_info`   | no       | Auto-attach hostname/OS/user/local IP to ticket details (default `true`) |
| `check_for_updates`     | no       | Silently check GitHub for newer releases on startup (default `true`) |
| `accent_color`          | no       | Hex color (e.g. `"#16a34a"`) to re-brand the accent color used in the New Ticket window |
| `company_name`          | no       | Shown in the New Ticket header ("<name> will get back to you...") |
| `support_phone`         | no       | Adds a "Call Support" tray menu item (tel: link) |
| `support_email`         | no       | Adds an "Email Support" tray menu item (mailto: link) |
| `branding_logo`         | no       | Absolute path to a `.png` to use as the tray icon and window header logo instead of the default RivetIT/RivetMSP icon |

The installer only prompts for the first five fields above; the branding
fields are optional and can be added by hand-editing `config.json` after
install (or templating it in your own deployment scripts).

### Other new features (v1.4.0+)

- **Open Client Portal** — tray menu item that opens the RivetIT/RivetMSP client
  portal (`{rivet_base_url}/client/`) in the default browser.
- **Asset auto-link** — the hostname of the machine is sent with every
  ticket and matched against the client's Assets in RivetIT/RivetMSP (by Asset Name
  or Asset Tag) to set the ticket's linked asset automatically.
- **Ticket categories** — if the RivetIT/RivetMSP instance has Ticket-type categories
  configured, a Category dropdown appears in the New Ticket window.
- **File attachments** — in addition to the screenshot tool, users can
  attach any file (log, error dialog export, etc.) via "Attach File".
- **Offline queue** — if the RivetIT/RivetMSP server is unreachable when a ticket is
  submitted, it's saved locally and retried automatically every 5 minutes.
- **My Recent Tickets** — tray menu item showing this install's recent
  tickets and their current status.
- **Status-change notifications** — a desktop notification is shown when a
  ticket submitted from this device changes status.
- **Quick Tools** — tray menu submenu with one-click troubleshooting: show
  this machine's public IP, ping google.com, list installed printers,
  restart the print spooler service (the last one may require running the
  app as Administrator), and open the Network Connections (`ncpa.cpl`)
  control panel.
